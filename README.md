# Holidog Challenge - Backend

Simple RESTful API built with NodeJS, Express and Mongoose, using my own MongoDB cluster to illustrate better app functionality and code.

## Notes

Endpoints were changed to better fit with RESTful conventions and good practices.

### Books endpoints

* **GET** /api/books
* **GET** /api/books/{id}
* **POST** /api/books
* **PUT** /api/books/{id}

### Authors endpoints

* **GET** /api/authors
* **GET** /api/authors/{id}
* **POST** /api/authors
* **PUT** /api/authors/{id}

## How to run it?

Please execute in root folder:

1. `npm install`
1. `node app.js`

## How to test it in my local environment?

Make requests to port 8080. Postman is recommended.
